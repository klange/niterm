.SH NAME
niterm - Japanese Framebuffer Terminal (Forked from bogl-bterm)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B niterm
.B -f
.RI font.bgf
.RI "[-l " locale "]"
.RI "[" program "]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B niterm
is a terminal emulator for the Linux framebuffer.  It supports multibyte
locales and wide characters, in addition to basic terminal features
such as cursor positioning. It is best to run a screen session under
niterm in order to support the additional escape sequences required for
normal terminal use.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -f font.bgf
Specify the font.  BGF fonts are produced by
.BR bdftobogl (1)
from standard BDF font files.
.TP
.B -l locale
Specify a locale for
.B niterm
and processes run within it.  The locale may also be specified
normally in the environment.  If a locale, especially one with a
different character set than the current locale, will be used inside
of
.B niterm,
it should be specified on the command line.
.SH EXIT STATUS
The following exit values are returned:
.TP
0
Successful completion.
.TP
1-125
Exit code from executed program
.TP
127
Failed to exec program
.TP
>=128
Program terminated by signal.
.SH NOTES
On Debian systems, one appropriate BDF font can be found in the
.B bf-utf-source
package.
